# Stream Aggregation Helper

Design, deploy, and verify [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/stream-aggregation/) rules
for VictoriaMetrics. Stream aggregation reduces cardinality, sample frequency, or query cost by aggregating samples
**by time and by labels** at `vmagent` (or single-node vmsingle) **before** they reach storage.

The skill walks through five phases:

1. **Gate** — is stream aggregation the right tool for this problem?
2. **Intake** — current cardinality, collection topology, what consumers need.
3. **Decide** — where in the pipeline, interval, output function, `by`/`without`, scaling.
4. **Config** — produce a ready-to-apply YAML plus a phased rollout plan.
5. **Verify** — queries and `vm_streamaggr_*` metrics that confirm the rule is doing what was intended.

## Environment

Uses the same env vars as the `victoriametrics-query` skill. The skill works **without** these (interview-only
mode) but is much more accurate when it can query the user's VictoriaMetrics directly.

```bash
# $VM_METRICS_URL - base URL (optional)
#   cluster: export VM_METRICS_URL="https://vmselect.example.com/select/0/prometheus"
#   single:  export VM_METRICS_URL="http://localhost:8428"
# $VM_CURL_CONFIG - curl config file with auth header (unset if no auth)
#   Remote: export VM_CURL_CONFIG="$HOME/.config/victoriametrics/curl.conf"
#   Local:  leave unset (defaults to /dev/null - no auth)
```

---

## Phase 1: Is stream aggregation the right tool?

Stream aggregation is the right answer when **all** of these hold:

- For every output series that the rule will produce, **all** input samples that contribute to it
  land on a single aggregator process. This holds in three common topologies:
  1. A single `vmagent` (or vmsingle) sees every sample for the matched series.
  2. Multiple vmagents shard traffic by some label (e.g., `instance`, `kubernetes_namespace`,
     `__name__`) and the aggregation **preserves that shard key** — see the shard-key invariant in
     Phase 3a (case F). Tiered topologies like *tier-1 vmagents shard by `instance` → tier-2
     vmagents aggregate within `instance`* are explicitly supported.
  3. HA replicas all see every sample **and** the aggregation output is dedup-safe (gauge-style:
     `min`, `max`, `avg`, `rate_*`, `increase*`, `last`, `quantiles`, etc.). Counter-style outputs
     (`total`, `total_prometheus`, `histogram_bucket`) cannot be HA-aggregated because each replica
     maintains independent monotonic state. See the High Availability section.
- The user is willing to lose per-source resolution (per-pod, per-instance) for the matched metric,
  OR only wants to drop a high-cardinality label they don't actually consume.
- Consumers (dashboards, alerts, recording rules) either don't need the dropped dimensions, or can
  be migrated to the aggregated metric name.
- State loss on `vmagent` restart is acceptable. Aggregation state is in-memory; on restart the
  first one or two intervals are discarded by default.

**Shard-key invariant**: an output series is correct only if every input sample for it goes to the
same aggregator. Translated to rules: the labels used to shard the stream must appear in `by:` (or
must not appear in `without:`) of every aggregation rule downstream of the shard. Drop them and you
get partial aggregates per shard — silently wrong.

If any of these fail, redirect the user:

| Situation | Better tool |
|-----------|-------------|
| Need to drop entire unused metrics | `metric_relabel_configs` with `action: drop` — see `victoriametrics-unused-metrics-analysis` |
| Need to drop labels without time-bucketing | `metric_relabel_configs` with `action: labeldrop`, or `-streamAggr.dropInputLabels` |
| Need historical downsampling on existing data | vmstorage downsampling (`-downsampling.period`) |
| Want a derived metric for queries, not ingestion | Recording rules in vmalert |
| Single-node setup but stream-aggregating before storage | `-streamAggr.config` on vmsingle is fine — same engine; just say so |
| Behind a load balancer that splits the stream (round-robin) | Shard traffic deterministically by labels (`-remoteWrite.shardByURL.labels`), then aggregate while preserving the shard key. Round-robin LBs split a single output series across replicas → incomplete results. See [Common Mistakes › Behind load balancer](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/stream-aggregation/#put-aggregator-behind-load-balancer) |
| Tiered vmagents (tier-1 shards, tier-2 aggregates) | Supported and common at scale. Aggregation rules on tier-2 must **keep the shard key** in `by:` (or omit it from `without:`). See case F below. |

If the gate passes, continue. If not, recommend the alternative and stop.

---

## Phase 2: Intake

Collect three groups of facts. Run the live queries in parallel **only if** `VM_METRICS_URL` is set; otherwise
ask the user the same questions directly.

### 2a. Cardinality picture

What metric/set is the problem? How many series, driven by which labels?

```bash
# Top series by metric name (find the offenders)
curl -q --config "${VM_CURL_CONFIG:-/dev/null}" -s \
  "$VM_METRICS_URL/api/v1/status/tsdb?topN=20" | \
  jq '.data | {totalSeries, seriesCountByMetricName, seriesCountByLabelName}'

# For each suspect metric, see unique values per label
curl -q --config "${VM_CURL_CONFIG:-/dev/null}" -s \
  "$VM_METRICS_URL/api/v1/status/tsdb?topN=20&match[]=METRIC_NAME" | \
  jq '.data.labelValueCountByLabelName'
```

**Measure post-aggregation cardinality directly.** Once you have a candidate `by:` or `without:`,
run the equivalent grouping against current data instead of multiplying per-label unique-value
counts. The product-of-labels formula assumes every Cartesian combination of label values exists,
which is rarely true — and worse, can be **over-optimistic** when there are correlated labels or
labels you forgot to enumerate. The measured count is authoritative:

```bash
# Post-aggregation series count, using the labels you plan to KEEP.
# Replace <metric> and <kept_labels>. For counters use rate(...[5m]); for gauges use last_over_time.
curl -q --config "${VM_CURL_CONFIG:-/dev/null}" -s \
  --data-urlencode 'query=count(sum(rate(<metric>[5m])) by (<kept_labels>))' \
  "$VM_METRICS_URL/api/v1/query" | jq '.data.result'

# Equivalent form using the labels you plan to DROP:
curl -q --config "${VM_CURL_CONFIG:-/dev/null}" -s \
  --data-urlencode 'query=count(sum(rate(<metric>[5m])) without (<dropped_labels>))' \
  "$VM_METRICS_URL/api/v1/query" | jq '.data.result'
```

This gives the actual number of output series the rule will produce *on the current data*, which is
the right basis for the savings estimate in Phase 4d. Run it for each candidate rule before
committing to a config.

Interview questions if live queries are unavailable:

- Which metric or metric pattern is the problem?
- Approximate total series count for it?
- Which labels exist on it, and roughly how many unique values for each?
- Counter, gauge, or histogram?
- Scrape interval / push frequency?

When live queries aren't possible, treat the product-of-labels formula as an **upper bound** only,
and note explicitly to the user that the real post-aggregation count must be verified once data is
reachable.

### 2b. Collection topology

How do samples flow today? Sketch one of these:

```
A: app  -> vmagent -> remote write -> TimeSeries DB         (vmagent already in path)
B: app  -> remote write -> TimeSeries DB                    (no vmagent — must insert one)
C: app  -> [Prometheus | OTel | StatsD-exporter] -> remote write -> TimeSeries DB
D: app  -> load balancer -> N vmagents -> TimeSeries DB     (LB splits stream — dangerous for SA)
E: app  -> vmagent (HA pair / N replicas) -> TimeSeries DB  (multi-vmagent — dedup needed)
F: app  -> vmagent cluster (sharded) -> TimeSeries DB       (sharded by `-remoteWrite.shardByURL`)
```

The destination is shown as a generic "TimeSeries DB" — stream aggregation is a vmagent-side feature
and works with any remote-write-compatible backend (vmstorage/vmsingle, Prometheus, Cortex, Mimir,
Thanos receive, etc.). Caveats below that reference vmstorage dedup (`-dedup.minScrapeInterval`)
apply specifically when the backend is VictoriaMetrics; for other backends, replicate dedup at the
backend or accept that HA aggregation will write duplicates.

Interview questions:

- Is `vmagent` already in the path? If yes, how many replicas?
- Are samples behind a load balancer before reaching the aggregator?
- Is the same series fed by exactly one source instance, or by many (e.g., HA pairs, multi-region)?
- For K8s users: `VMAgent` CRD (vm-operator) or raw deployment?

### 2c. Consumer intent

What do downstream queries actually need?

- What resolution do dashboards/alerts query at? (e.g., `rate(...[5m])`, p99 over 5m)
- Do any consumers need per-pod / per-instance resolution for this metric? If "no, only service-wide"
  — that's the strongest signal that SA fits.
- Is the metric name referenced in alerting rules or recording rules? Renaming the metric after SA
  breaks those — track which queries must be updated.
- Are there separate destinations that want different aggregations? If yes, use **per-remote-write**
  configs (`-remoteWrite.streamAggr.config`); otherwise prefer global (`-streamAggr.config`).

---

## Phase 3: Decisions

For each metric or group, decide five things.

### 3a. Where to deploy vmagent

| Topology | Fits SA? | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **A. vmagent already in path, single replica** | Best. | Aggregation is exact — one vmagent sees every sample. |
| **B. No vmagent yet** | Insert vmagent **just before** the storage hop. | Adds one process, but you get aggregation + buffering + retries for free. |
| **C. Behind Prometheus/OTel collector** | Insert vmagent **between** the collector and remote write, or replace the collector with vmagent if scraping is acceptable. | Don't aggregate inside the collector unless it supports streaming aggregation. |
| **D. Behind a load balancer** | **Do not aggregate.** Each vmagent sees a fraction of samples → incomplete aggregates. | Shard traffic by `__name__` or labels first (`-remoteWrite.shardByURL.labels`), or terminate at a single aggregator. |
| **E. Multiple vmagent replicas (HA)** | Fits **only** for dedup-safe outputs (gauge-style: `min`, `max`, `avg`, `rate_*`, `increase*`, `last`, `quantiles`, `sum_samples`, etc.). All replicas must receive **identical** input, run **identical** config, and produce **identical** output labels — vmstorage dedup (`-dedup.minScrapeInterval`) collapses the duplicates. Do **not** tag replicas distinctly: that turns dedup-safe series into permanently doubled series at storage. Counter-style outputs (`total`, `total_prometheus`, `histogram_bucket`) cannot be HA'd this way — each replica's monotonic state diverges after restart. | See the High Availability section. |
| **F. Sharded vmagent fleet (single tier or tier-1 of a multi-tier topology)** | Fits if the aggregation respects the shard key. The shard label(s) — e.g., `instance`, `kubernetes_namespace`, `__name__` — must appear in every downstream rule's `by:` list, or equivalently must be **absent** from `without:`. Drop the shard key and each shard produces its own slice of the answer → silently wrong totals. | Common configurations: shard by `instance` and aggregate `by: [instance, method, status_code, le]`; shard by `kubernetes_namespace` and aggregate `by: [kubernetes_namespace, workload]`. If the shard key actively splits a series across shards (e.g., sharding by `pod` when you want to aggregate across pods), the topology can't satisfy the shard-key invariant — re-shard, or aggregate on the tier-1 vmagents before sharding. **Never shard by `le` (or `vmrange`) when aggregating histograms** — a single histogram's buckets must all land on the same aggregator. Sharding by `le` routes `le="0.1"`, `le="0.5"`, `le="+Inf"`, etc. for the same histogram to different shards; each shard sees only part of the bucket set, `histogram_quantile()` becomes incoherent, and quantiles silently drift. Shard histograms by a non-bucket label such as `instance`, `kubernetes_namespace`, or `__name__`. |

### 3b. Aggregation interval

Two constraints decide `interval`:

1. **Lower bound**: at least **2× the scrape/push interval** of the input. Anything less risks empty
   buckets when a single sample lands. Default to `2× scrape_interval` (so 30s for 15s scrapes).
2. **Upper bound**: no longer than the **shortest consumer query range**. If alerts use `rate(...[2m])`
   the interval must be ≤ 1m, ideally 30s. For dashboards with 5m windows, 1m is fine.

Other modifiers:

- **High delay / sample skew** → use a longer interval, or enable `enable_windows: true` (doubles
  memory but uses two-window state for accuracy). Critical for histograms.
- **Replacing a recording rule** → match the rule's evaluation interval (commonly 1m).
- **Downsampling for storage cost** → 1m–5m is typical; longer than 5m sacrifices interactive querying.

Default: **`interval: 30s`** for high-frequency app metrics, **`interval: 1m`** when replacing recording
rules, **`interval: 5m`** for pure downsampling.

### 3c. Output function

This is the most-frequently-wrong choice. Pick by metric kind first, then by what the consumer needs.

| Input kind | Consumer needs | Output | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|--------|-------|
| **Counter** | Sum of rate per output series (e.g., `sum(rate(req_total[5m]))`) | `rate_sum` | Result is a gauge of per-second rate. Query directly with `sum/avg_over_time` — do **not** take `rate()` again. |
| **Counter** | Increase per interval, as a counter for `rate()` later | `total` | Output is a monotonic counter resilient to per-source resets and series churn. Query with `rate()`. Use `total_prometheus` to skip the first sample per series. |
| **Counter** | Increase per interval, as a value (not a counter) | `increase` / `increase_prometheus` | Output is a gauge of the per-interval delta. |
| **Counter** | Average rate across input series | `rate_avg` | Use when you want mean-of-rates instead of sum-of-rates. |
| **Histogram bucket** (`*_bucket`, le-style) | `histogram_quantile()` | **`rate_sum`** + `enable_windows: true` | Recommended pattern. Bucket sets must match across aggregated series. |
| **Histogram bucket** | Total bucket counts as counter | `total` | Acceptable but more reset-sensitive than `rate_sum`. |
| **Gauge** | Latest value | `last` | Cheapest. Matches `last_over_time`. |
| **Gauge** | Sum across instances | `sum_samples` | E.g., total memory across pods. |
| **Gauge** | Min / Max / Avg | `min` / `max` / `avg` | Same name as the function. |
| **Gauge** | Distribution / percentiles | `quantiles(0.5, 0.9, 0.99)` or `histogram_bucket` | `quantiles` emits one output series per phi tagged with a `quantile="<phi>"` label. `histogram_bucket` returns VictoriaMetrics-style buckets you can later quantile-query — choose it when you need arbitrary quantiles later, `quantiles(...)` when the set is fixed. |
| **Gauge** | Count of unique values | `unique_samples` | Niche; for cardinality-style measurements. |
| **Either** | Sample count | `count_samples` / `count_series` | `count_samples` = how many points landed. `count_series` = how many distinct series existed in the interval. |

**The single most common mistake** is using `total` on a gauge or `sum_samples` on a counter — both
produce nonsense. **Counter → `total`/`rate_*`/`increase*`. Gauge → everything else.**

### 3d. `by` vs `without`

- Use **`without:`** when you know the labels to drop (e.g., `pod`, `instance`). The skill should
  prefer `without` — it's less error-prone if new labels appear later.
- Use **`by:`** when you know the exact set of labels to keep, and want a hard guarantee that any
  new label is dropped. Required when the input has many uncontrolled labels.
- Always keep **`le`** when aggregating histogram buckets.
- Always keep the labels your downstream queries already group by.
- Drop labels that are obviously high-cardinality and not consumed: `pod`, `instance`, `replica`,
  `container_id`. For **sharded** topologies (case F), keep the shard key. For
  **HA** topologies (case E), keep label sets *identical* across replicas — no per-replica tag.
- **`drop_input_labels` vs `without`/`by`**: both remove a label from the output. Prefer
  `drop_input_labels` (or the `-streamAggr.dropInputLabels` flag) when the label is **unbounded**
  (e.g., `request_id`, `trace_id`, `session_id`): it strips the label *before* dedup and state
  keying, so the aggregator never allocates per-value state for it — even transiently. Use
  `without`/`by` when the label has a reasonable cardinality but you don't want it on the output.

### 3e. Scale vmagent?

A single vmagent handles **millions of samples/sec** on modest hardware. Scale only when:

- CPU usage on the aggregating vmagent stays >70% with current load.
- `histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(vm_streamaggr_flush_duration_seconds_bucket[1m])) by (vmrange))` approaches the aggregation interval.
- Memory pressure from many active output series (each output series ≈ small constant of RAM; with
  `enable_windows: true` it doubles).
- Input rate is sharded across many sources and consolidating in one vmagent is impractical.

When scaling:

- **Shard by series** (`-remoteWrite.shardByURL.labels`) so each input series lands on exactly one
  vmagent. Each shard produces a distinct slice of the output (different label values for the
  shard key); roll-up across shards happens at query time. See Phase 3a (case F).
- **HA replicas** (every replica sees every sample): use identical config and identical output
  labels; vmstorage dedup collapses duplicates. Only valid for dedup-safe outputs. See the High
  Availability section.

### 3f. How the aggregated output will be consumed

Two related decisions: what flows downstream alongside the aggregate, and what the aggregated metric
is called.

**Input retention** — what happens to the raw (unaggregated) samples after a rule matches them.
These are **command-line flags** (or per-remote-write equivalents), not YAML fields:

| User intent | Flag setting | Result |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| **Aggregates only — drop matched raw** *(default steady state)* | neither flag | Aggregates written. Matched raw dropped. Unmatched-by-rule samples still written. Most common end state. |
| **Both raw and aggregates** *(rollout stage 2, or transition periods where consumers still need full resolution)* | `-streamAggr.keepInput=true` (or `-remoteWrite.streamAggr.keepInput=true`) | Aggregates + **all** raw samples written. Cardinality reduction is not yet realized — use temporarily. |
| **Aggregates only — drop everything that doesn't match the rules either** *(dedicated archive / long-term path)* | `-streamAggr.dropInput=true` (or `-remoteWrite.streamAggr.dropInput=true`) | Aggregates written. Matched and unmatched raw both dropped. Reach for this only when the destination should contain **nothing but aggregates** — e.g., a per-remote-write SA config aimed at a long-term store, with another (non-aggregating) remote-write carrying full-resolution data elsewhere. |

These flags compose with the rollout phases in 4c: typically start with `keepInput=true` during
verification, then remove it to reach the default steady state; only set `dropInput=true` if the
destination is purely an aggregate sink.

**Output metric naming** — by default the aggregated metric name is auto-generated and
self-describing:

```
<original_name>:<interval>[_by_<labels>][_without_<labels>]_<output>
```

with label lists sorted alphabetically, and a `quantile="<phi>"` label per output series when the
output is `quantiles(...)`. **Prefer the default** — it makes the aggregate distinguishable from the
raw metric at query time and prevents collisions if raw is still flowing.

Override only when there's a concrete reason:

- `keep_metric_names: true` (per-rule) — keeps the original metric name on the aggregated series.
  Valid **only** with a single entry in `outputs:`. Safe under the default behavior (matched raw is
  dropped from remote-write automatically). Risky if you've set `-streamAggr.keepInput=true`, since
  then aggregates and matched raw share the same name with different semantics — flip back to
  default before enabling `keep_metric_names`.
- `output_relabel_configs:` (per-rule) — full relabeling on the aggregated samples before they're
  written. Use it to strip the suffix, enforce a project naming convention, or rewrite labels:

  ```yaml
  output_relabel_configs:
    # Strip the auto-added ":interval_..._output" suffix
    - source_labels: [__name__]
      regex: '(.+):.+'
      target_label: __name__
      replacement: '$1'

    # Or enforce an "agg_" prefix
    - source_labels: [__name__]
      regex: '(.+)'
      target_label: __name__
      replacement: 'agg_$1'
  ```

  When you rename, plan the corresponding consumer migration (dashboards, alerts, recording rules) —
  see Phase 4c stage 4.

### 3g. Resolution vs. SA interval — replacing `sum(rate(X[5m]))`

A common request is "I have `sum(rate(req_total[5m]))` in my dashboards and alerts — please
pre-aggregate it." The naive mapping is to match the SA interval to the rate window:

```yaml
- match: 'req_total'
  interval: 5m            # too coarse — see below
  by: [<labels>]
  outputs: [rate_sum]
```

This produces **one datapoint every 5 minutes**. That resolution is often too coarse for alerting
(alerts evaluate every 30s–1m and need recent samples) and for graphs (5-minute step looks like a
staircase). The original `rate(...[5m])` also gave you a *rolling* 5m window evaluated at every
scrape; a 5m SA interval gives you a tumbling 5m bucket — those are not the same.

**Recommended default**: use a finer SA interval (typically `1m`) and reconstruct the rolling
smoothing at **query time** with `avg_over_time`:

```yaml
- match: 'req_total'
  interval: 1m
  by: [<labels>]
  outputs: [rate_sum]
```

Query rewrites:

```promql
# Original
sum(rate(req_total[5m]))

# After SA with interval: 1m, rate_sum  (rate_sum is already per-second, so don't rate() again)
sum(avg_over_time(req_total:1m_..._rate_sum[5m]))

# Original with grouping
sum by (route) (rate(req_total[5m]))

# After SA — use a subquery to apply avg_over_time after the sum-by
avg_over_time(
  (sum(req_total:1m_..._rate_sum) by (route))[5m:1m]
)
```

The `[5m:1m]` subquery means "evaluate the inner expression at 1m steps over a 5m window" — i.e.,
exactly the rolling-5m-window-every-1m behavior the original `rate(...[5m])` produced.

Trade-off table:

| SA `interval` | Samples written per 5m | When it fits |
|---------------|------------------------|--------------|
| `5m` | 1 | Backfill / long-term archive only. Acceptable when no consumer queries faster than 5m and a staircase graph is fine. |
| `1m` *(default for `[5m]` consumers)* | 5 | High-resolution graphs and alerts; `avg_over_time(...[5m])` at query time reproduces the original smoothing. |
| `30s` | 10 | Consumers use shorter windows (`[2m]`, `[1m]`) or zoom into sub-minute graphs. Often overkill. |

The same principle applies to `increase`, `increase_prometheus`, `rate_avg`, and gauge outputs
(`min`, `max`, `avg`, `sum_samples`): pick the SA interval based on the **fastest cadence any
consumer wants to query at**, not the largest range window the consumer uses. Reconstruct the range
window with the matching `*_over_time` wrapper at query time.

---

## Phase 4: Config + Rollout

Produce a single, self-contained plan that the user can read top-to-bottom and apply without
clicking through to docs. The expected output shape — adapt to the actual rule, omit sections that
don't apply:

> **Stream aggregation plan: `http_duration_p99`**
>
> | Decision | Choice | Why |
> |----------|--------|-----|
> | Placement | Existing tier-2 vmagent | Already in path; tier-1 shards by `kubernetes_namespace`, tier-2 aggregates within it |
> | Interval | `1m` | 2× scrape (15s); consumers use `[5m]` windows — reconstruct rolling avg at query time (Phase 3g) |
> | Output | `rate_sum` + `enable_windows: true` | Histogram → recommended pattern; consumers want p99 |
> | Grouping | `without: [pod, instance, path]` | Drop per-source + raw URL; keep `kubernetes_namespace` (shard key), `method`, `status_code`, `route`, `le` |
> | Input retention | default (matched raw dropped from remote write after cutover) | No consumer needs raw post-cutover |
> | Series before → after | ~5.3M → **~8.8K** (measured via `count(sum by (...)(rate(...[5m])))`) | ~600× reduction |
> | HA / sharding | Tier-2 has 2 HA replicas; identical config, identical labels, dedup at storage | Output is `rate_sum` (HA-safe). Do not tag replicas. |

> ```
> </details>

Adapt the structure for the actual scenario: a gauge with `quantiles(0.95)` won't need `enable_windows`; a downsampling rule replacing a recording rule may skip the cross-check (no raw to compare to). Drop the HA row if the deployment is single-replica.

### 4a. Generate the config

Template:

```yaml
- name: <descriptive_name>             # shows up in vm_streamaggr_* metrics
  match: '<series_selector>'           # e.g. '{__name__=~"http_request_.*"}'
  interval: <30s|1m|5m>
  # enable_windows: true               # REQUIRED for histograms; recommended when samples are delayed
  # staleness_interval: 2m             # default 2*interval; raise it if input is sporadic
  # ignore_first_sample_interval: 2m   # for total/increase/histogram_bucket after restart
  # ignore_old_samples: true           # if the stream contains backfilled / replayed data, is automatically applied when enable_windows are enabled
  without: [pod, instance, replica]    # or: by: [route, method, status_code, le]
  outputs: [rate_sum]                  # see output picker above
  # keep_metric_names: true            # only with a single output; drops the ":interval_..." suffix
  # drop_input_labels: [container_id]  # drops labels *before* dedup + aggregation
  # input_relabel_configs: [...]       # rare; transform labels before aggregating
  # output_relabel_configs: [...]      # rare; e.g. strip the auto-added suffix
```

**Do not** put `keep_input` or `drop_input` inside the YAML — those are command-line flags
(`-streamAggr.keepInput`, `-streamAggr.dropInput`, plus per-remote-write variants). Several common
guides get this wrong.

Chose `name` field to reflect original metric name and aggregation output, but keep it simple enough that's easy to understand.

### 4b. Where the config lives

| Mechanism | Use when |
|-----------|----------|
| `-streamAggr.config` | One global config replicated to all `-remoteWrite.url` destinations. **Default choice.** Aggregation runs once. |
| `-remoteWrite.streamAggr.config` (per URL) | Different destinations need different aggregates (e.g., long-term store gets aggregated only). Aggregation runs per destination — more CPU. |
| vmsingle `-streamAggr.config` | Single-node setup; same engine, same YAML. |

### 4c. Phased rollout

1. **Stage 1 — observe**. Deploy with input retained, so both raw and aggregated land in storage:
   - Don't set `-streamAggr.dropInput` (default keeps unmatched + writes aggregates).
   - Set `-streamAggr.keepInput=true` to **also** write the matched raw samples. This lets you
     compare raw vs aggregated queries side-by-side.
2. **Stage 2 — verify** (see Phase 5). Aggregated output should match the corresponding
   `sum(rate(...))` / `histogram_quantile(...)` over raw for at least an hour, including across a
   vmagent restart if possible.
3. **Stage 3 — cut over**. Remove `-streamAggr.keepInput`. That's it — the cardinality reduction is
   realized at this point. The default SA behavior writes aggregates and **drops matched raw
   samples** from the remote-write output (only the unmatched-by-rule samples continue to flow as
   raw). You do **not** need to drop the raw metric at the scrape side; in fact you must **not**,
   because vmagent's pipeline is `scrape → relabel → dedup → stream aggregation → remote write`, so
   a scrape-side drop removes the input the aggregator needs and the rule produces nothing.

   Optionally set `-streamAggr.dropInput=true` only if you also want to drop all *unmatched-by-rule*
   samples (rare; appropriate when this remote-write destination is dedicated to aggregates and
   another remote-write carries the full-resolution data). See Phase 3f for the three input-retention
   modes.
4. **Stage 4 — migrate consumers**. Update dashboards / alerts to the new metric name (with the
   auto-added suffix). The suffix format is `:<interval>[_by_<labels>][_without_<labels>]_<output>`
   where **both** label lists are sorted alphabetically — `without: [pod, instance, path]` yields
   `_without_instance_path_pod_`; `by: [function, region, cold_start]` yields
   `_by_cold_start_function_region_`. For `outputs: [quantiles(0.5, 0.99)]` each output series also
   carries a `quantile="<phi>"` label. If you'd rather keep the original metric name, set
   `keep_metric_names: true` (valid only with a single output), and make sure raw is fully dropped or
   you'll have two series with the same name and different semantics.

Reload without restart:

```bash
kill -SIGHUP $(pidof vmagent)
# or
curl -X POST http://vmagent:8429/-/reload
```

### 4d. Estimate the savings

For each rule, give the user two numbers:

- **Series before** (current): from `seriesCountByMetricName` in TSDB status, or user-reported.
- **Series after** (measured): the count returned by the `count(sum(rate(<metric>[5m])) by (<kept_labels>))`
  query in Phase 2a, run against current data. This is the authoritative number — the rule will
  produce roughly this many output series on the current data.

Only fall back to the product-of-labels formula when live data isn't reachable, and label it as an
upper bound:

```
output_series ≤ Π(unique values of each label in `by`, including __name__)
```

The product overestimates when label values are correlated (most routes don't return every status
code) and can also *under*estimate when there are labels the user didn't enumerate — both reasons
to prefer the measured count.

Sanity check: if the measured after-aggregation count is **larger** than before, the `by`/`without`
is wrong — you're keeping labels that produce more unique combinations than expected.

---

## Phase 5: Verify

After the rule is live, run these checks. Use them in stage 2 (with raw retained) and again in
stage 3.

### 5a. Stream aggregation internal metrics

Check metrics exposed by vmagent that does the aggregation (or check them on the vmagent [Grafana dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12683-victoriametrics-vmagent/) in `Stream aggregation` section):

| Metric                                            | What it tells you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `vm_streamaggr_matched_samples_total{name="..."}` | Input samples matched by the rule. Should match expected scrape rate × series count.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `vm_streamaggr_output_samples_total{name="..."}`  | Aggregated samples emitted. Roughly `output_series / aggregation_interval`.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `vm_streamaggr_flush_duration_seconds_bucket`     | Time spent flushing each interval. Can be calculated as `histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(vm_streamaggr_flush_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))` to get 99th percentile. Should be well below `interval`. If close to interval, scale vmagent or raise `interval`. |
| `vm_streamaggr_ignored_samples_total`             | Samples dropped due to different reasons. Spikes in `too_old` reasin may indicates upstream delays. See also `vm_streamaggr_samples_lag_seconds_bucket` for the delivery lag.                                                                               |
| `vm_streamaggr_counter_resets_total`              | Counter resets observed. **Sudden spike** = duplicate or colliding input samples; check for upstream issues or a misconfigured topology (e.g., HA replicas with a counter-style output, see High Availability section).                                     |

### 5b. Cross-check aggregated vs raw (stage 2 only)

For a counter aggregated with `rate_sum`:

```promql
# raw
sum by (route, method, le) (rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))

# aggregated (rate_sum is already a per-second rate — sum it, don't rate it again)
sum by (route, method, le) (http_request_duration_seconds_bucket:30s_without_pod_instance_rate_sum)
```

The two should track within a few percent. If they diverge sharply, suspect:

- Multi-vmagent collision (Phase 3a, case E).
- Behind a load balancer (Phase 3a, case D).
- Mismatched `dedup_interval` vs storage `-dedup.minScrapeInterval`.
- For histograms: sample delays — enable `enable_windows` and/or raise `interval`.

For histograms via `rate_sum`:

```promql
# raw p99
histogram_quantile(0.99, sum by (le) (rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])))

# aggregated p99
histogram_quantile(0.99, sum by (le) (avg_over_time(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket:30s_without_pod_instance_rate_sum[5m])))
```

### 5c. Sanity checks

- Output series count from `count({__name__="<aggregated_name>"})` ≈ your Phase 4d estimate.
- No alerts about `histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(vm_streamaggr_flush_duration_seconds_bucket[1m])) by (vmrange))` approaching interval.
- For `total`/`increase` outputs: counter is monotonic; resets only on vmagent restart (which is
  expected unless `flush_on_shutdown: true` is set).

---

## High Availability

Running multiple vmagent replicas for resilience is supported, but only under specific conditions —
stream aggregation maintains state in the aggregator process, and that state cannot be replicated
across replicas.

### The mechanism

Multiple replicas produce the **same** output series — identical label sets — and let
vmstorage's deduplication collapse the duplicates. This works **only** when:

1. Every replica receives **identical input** — same scrape targets, or fan-out (not round-robin)
   remote-write. A round-robin load balancer in front of HA replicas splits the stream, which both
   defeats HA *and* produces incomplete aggregates per replica.
2. Every replica runs **identical aggregation configuration**.
3. Every replica produces output samples with **identical labels** (no per-replica tagging — see
   below).
4. vmstorage has `-dedup.minScrapeInterval` set (usually equal to the aggregation `interval`); the
   per-rule `dedup_interval` should match.
5. The chosen aggregation output is dedup-safe (next section).

**Do not** tag HA replicas with distinct labels (`-remoteWrite.label=vmagent=A`, `=B`). Distinct
labels make the series genuinely different — vmstorage won't dedup, you pay double the storage, and
the consumer must `sum without (vmagent)` everywhere. The "tag each replica" pattern is for
*sharded* topologies (case F), where each replica sees a disjoint slice of inputs and must keep
them apart, not for HA where replicas see the same inputs.

### HA-safe vs unsafe outputs

| Output | HA-safe? | Why |
|--------|---------|-----|
| `min`, `max`, `avg`, `last`, `sum_samples`, `count_samples`, `count_series`, `unique_samples`, `stddev`, `stdvar`, `quantiles(...)` | ✅ | Each interval's value is computed independently from samples seen in that interval. Two replicas that see the same input converge to the same value → dedup is clean. |
| `rate_sum`, `rate_avg`, `increase`, `increase_prometheus` | ✅ (with caveat) | Output is a **per-interval gauge** of rate or delta, not a monotonic counter. Internal per-series state can briefly diverge after one replica restarts (until the next staleness window), but the output values converge. |
| `total`, `total_prometheus` | ❌ | Output is a **monotonically increasing counter** held in aggregator memory. After one replica restarts, its output resets to 0 while the other's keeps climbing. Dedup picks one sample per (series, timestamp) — with two divergent counter streams emitting at the same series, the consumer sees an alternating sequence, and `rate()` reads the backward steps as counter resets, producing visible jumps and spikes. There is no clean way to dedupe two divergent monotonic counters. |
| `histogram_bucket` | ❌ | Per-bucket counters accumulate the same way `total` does. Same divergence problem. |

For consumers that insist on a counter shape (e.g., legacy alerts using `rate(...[5m])`), the
HA-safe options are:

- Switch the aggregation to `rate_sum` and update the query (`rate_sum` is already a per-second
  rate — sum/avg it instead of taking `rate()`).
- Switch to `increase` and use `increase`-style queries.
- Run a single aggregator (active/passive failover) instead of true HA — accept brief gaps during
  failover rather than divergent monotonic state.

### HA vs sharding — different patterns, don't combine on the same dimension

- **Sharded** (case F): each replica sees a *disjoint slice* of inputs. Each emits distinct output
  series — either by keeping the shard key in `by:` (preferred — roll up at query time), or by
  tagging with a unique label. Different replicas produce different values intentionally.
- **HA** (case E): every replica sees the *same* inputs and emits the *same* output labels.
  Different replicas produce equal values that vmstorage dedup collapses.

A tier-1-sharded + tier-2-HA topology is valid: tier-1 shards by `instance`; each tier-1 shard
fans out to two tier-2 HA replicas that both see the same shard's stream and emit identical
output. The shard key (`instance`) appears in `by:` on tier-2; HA replicas at tier-2 are otherwise
configured identically.

---

## Risk Callouts (tied to output choice)

Surface these **only** when the chosen output triggers them — don't dump them all unconditionally.

### When output ∈ {`total`, `total_prometheus`, `increase`, `increase_prometheus`, `rate_avg`, `rate_sum`, `histogram_bucket`}

- **Staleness**: per-series state is reset after `staleness_interval` (default `2 × interval`) without
  new samples. For sporadic inputs (Lambda, cron jobs, batch workers), raise `staleness_interval` or
  values will spike on re-appearance. See [Staleness](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/stream-aggregation/#staleness).

### When inputs are sporadic (any output, especially gauges)

- Even for outputs without per-series state (e.g., `quantiles`, `last`, `sum_samples`), a long gap
  between samples means the corresponding output series is *missing* for those intervals — gauges in
  dashboards will have gaps. Raise `staleness_interval` to cover the maximum expected silence, or
  use `last_over_time(<aggregated>[<gap>])` at query time to paper over short absences.
- **First sample after restart**: `total`/`increase` assume new series start at 0, so the first
  sample after a restart looks like a huge increase. Set `ignore_first_sample_interval` or use
  `*_prometheus` variants to skip the first sample.
- **Counter resets** (`vm_streamaggr_counter_resets_total` ticking up): duplicate samples or
  collision between vmagent replicas. Either dedup before aggregation (`dedup_interval`) or ensure
  each output series is produced by exactly one aggregator.

### When aggregating histograms (any output)

- **Bucket consistency**: histograms can only be aggregated if their `le` (or `vmrange`) labels are
  identical across input series. Inconsistent bucket boundaries → silently wrong quantiles.
- **Sample delay sensitivity**: histograms are a logical group of series that must update together.
  Misaligned samples → wrong quantiles. Mitigations: **`enable_windows: true`**, longer `interval`,
  ensure vmagent + delivery pipeline have headroom (no queue accumulation).
- **+Inf bucket**: must exist on inputs; `histogram_quantile` requires it.
- **Never shard by `le` (or `vmrange`)**: in a sharded vmagent topology (case F), the shard key must
  not be the bucket label. A histogram is a logical group of series differing only in `le` — all of
  those buckets must land on the same aggregator so it can produce a coherent bucket set. Sharding
  by `le` splits one histogram's buckets across shards; each shard then emits a partial bucket set,
  and `histogram_quantile()` over the merged result is silently wrong. Pick a non-bucket label
  (`instance`, `kubernetes_namespace`, `__name__`, etc.) as the shard key, and keep `le` in every
  aggregation rule's `by:` list.

### When running multiple vmagent replicas

- **HA topology** (every replica sees every sample): identical input + identical config + identical
  output labels → vmstorage dedup collapses duplicates. Don't tag replicas. Only works for
  dedup-safe outputs — see the High Availability section.
- **Sharded topology** (each replica owns a disjoint slice — case F): keep the shard key in `by:`,
  or, if you can't, tag each replica with a unique label and re-aggregate at query time with
  `sum without (vmagent) (...)`. See [cluster mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/stream-aggregation/#cluster-mode).
- Round-robin LBs in front of replicas are wrong for **both** patterns: HA loses dedup safety
  (each replica sees a partial stream), and sharded loses determinism. Use deterministic
  `-remoteWrite.shardByURL.labels=...` for sharding, or fan-out (every replica receives every
  sample) for HA.

### When dedup is enabled

- `dedup_interval` must equal storage `-dedup.minScrapeInterval`. Mismatch → raw query results
  (e.g. `sum(rate(...))`) won't match the aggregated metric. See [common mistakes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/stream-aggregation/#use-different-deduplication-intervals-on-storage-and-vmagent).

## Kubernetes / VictoriaMetrics Operator

Stream aggregation config is exposed on the `VMAgent` CRD via `streamAggrConfig` (global) or
`remoteWrite[].streamAggrConfig` (per destination).

<details>
<summary>VMAgent CRD — global stream aggregation</summary>

The vm-operator exposes `streamAggrConfig` with camelCase fields. `keepInput`/`dropInput` are
top-level fields here (mirroring the `-streamAggr.keepInput` / `-streamAggr.dropInput` flags), not
fields inside individual rules. Field spelling depends on operator version — confirm against the
[VMAgent CRD reference](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/operator/api/#vmagent) if unsure.

```yaml

  # Do NOT add a per-replica externalLabel for HA — it defeats vmstorage dedup. See HA section.
  extraArgs:

<details>
<summary>Two-tier topology — tier-1 shards, tier-2 aggregates (shard key = <code>instance</code>)</summary>

Tier-1 vmagents shard by `instance` to tier-2 aggregating vmagents. Each tier-2 instance owns a
disjoint slice of `instance` values, so it sees every sample for those instances and can produce
correct aggregates — **as long as** `instance` is preserved in `by:`.

Tier-1 (sharding only, no aggregation):

```bash
vmagent-tier1 \
  -remoteWrite.url=http://vmagent-tier2-0:8429/api/v1/write \
  -remoteWrite.url=http://vmagent-tier2-1:8429/api/v1/write \
  -remoteWrite.url=http://vmagent-tier2-2:8429/api/v1/write \
  -remoteWrite.shardByURL=true \
  -remoteWrite.shardByURL.labels=instance
```

Tier-2 (aggregation that respects the shard key):

```yaml
# tier2-stream-aggr.yaml
- match: 'http_request_duration_seconds_bucket'
  interval: 30s
  enable_windows: true
  by: [instance, method, status_code, route, le]   # `instance` MUST stay — it's the shard key
  outputs: [rate_sum]
```

```bash
vmagent-tier2 \
  -remoteWrite.url=http://vmstorage:8429/api/v1/write \
  -streamAggr.config=/etc/vmagent/tier2-stream-aggr.yaml
```

If you also want a per-service rollup (without `instance`), do it at **query time** —
`sum without (instance) (http_request_duration_seconds_bucket:30s_by_...:rate_sum)` — not in a
second aggregation rule on tier-2, because each tier-2 only has its slice of instances.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Bare metal / Docker — command-line flags</summary>

```bash
vmagent \
  -remoteWrite.url=http://vmsingle:8429/api/v1/write \
  -streamAggr.config=/etc/vmagent/stream-aggr.yaml \
  -streamAggr.dedupInterval=30s \
  -streamAggr.keepInput=true                        # stage 2 only
```

For HA (every replica scrapes the same targets, dedup-safe output only): omit any per-replica label
— identical labels are required for vmstorage dedup to collapse duplicates. For *sharded* topologies
where each replica owns a disjoint slice (case F), add a per-replica label *only if* the shard key
isn't already preserved in `by:`:

```bash
  -remoteWrite.label=vmagent=$HOSTNAME   # sharded ≠ HA; do NOT use this for HA
```
</details>

## Worked Example

User: "600 pods, `http_request_duration_seconds_bucket` exploding, labels `pod, instance, method, path,
status_code, le, route`, 40 routes, 10 le buckets, vmagent already in path, only need service-wide p99."

Decisions:

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Gate | passes — vmagent in path, lose-per-pod is acceptable | |
| Interval | `30s` | 2× the 15s scrape interval; matches 5m query windows. |
| Output | `rate_sum` + `enable_windows: true` | Histogram bucket → recommended pattern; consumer is `histogram_quantile`. |
| `without` | `[pod, instance, path]` (assuming `route` is the normalized form) | Drop everything not needed; keep `method`, `status_code`, `route`, `le`. |
| Placement | Existing vmagent | Already in path. Confirm only one replica or use HA tagging. |
| Scale | No | Single rule; current vmagent fine. |

Estimate: `4 methods × 5 status × 40 routes × 11 buckets (incl. +Inf) ≈ 8.8K series` vs `600 pods × 8.8K ≈ 5.3M` raw → ~600× reduction.

Config:

```yaml
- name: http_duration_p99
  match: 'http_request_duration_seconds_bucket'
  interval: 30s
  enable_windows: true
  without: [pod, instance, path]
  outputs: [rate_sum]
```

Rollout: enable `-streamAggr.keepInput=true`, deploy, verify with the cross-check query in Phase 5b
for one hour, then drop the flag. Once `keepInput` is gone, matched raw is no longer written to
remote storage by default — the cardinality reduction is realized. Do not drop the metric at the
scrape side; that would remove the input the aggregator depends on.

Consumer query update — note the suffix sorts labels alphabetically (`instance, path, pod`):

```promql
# Before
histogram_quantile(0.99, sum by (le) (rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])))

# After
histogram_quantile(0.99,
  sum by (le, route) (
    avg_over_time(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket:30s_without_instance_path_pod_rate_sum[5m])
  )
)
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Putting `keep_input` / `drop_input` in the YAML | Those are command-line flags (`-streamAggr.keepInput`, `-streamAggr.dropInput`, or per-remote-write variants). |
| Using `total` on a gauge | `total` is for counters. Use `last`/`avg`/`sum_samples` for gauges. |
| Using `sum_samples` on a counter | Sums raw counter values — meaningless. Use `total`, `increase`, or `rate_sum`. |
| Querying `rate_sum` output with `rate()` | `rate_sum` is already a per-second rate. Sum/avg it, don't rate it. |
| Querying `total` output without `rate()` | `total` is a monotonic counter — use `rate()` or `increase()`. |
| Interval shorter than scrape interval | Empty buckets, jittery output. Set `interval ≥ 2× scrape_interval`. |
| Tagging HA replicas with a distinct `vmagent=...` label | Defeats vmstorage dedup → permanently doubled series at storage. For HA, replicas must emit *identical* labels; dedup collapses them. The "tag each replica" pattern is for sharded topologies, not HA. |
| Running HA replicas with a `total` or `total_prometheus` output | Counter state is in-process and diverges after a single replica restart → consumer sees jumps. Switch to `rate_sum` or `increase`, or run a single aggregator. |
| HA replicas behind a round-robin load balancer | Each replica sees a partial stream → aggregates are incomplete AND can't dedup. Use fan-out (every replica receives every sample) or deterministic sharding. |
| Aggregator behind a round-robin load balancer | Each vmagent sees a slice → incomplete aggregates. Shard deterministically by labels (`-remoteWrite.shardByURL.labels`) first, or terminate at one aggregator. |
| Sharded vmagents that drop the shard key in `without:` (or omit it from `by:`) | Each shard produces a partial aggregate over its slice of inputs; outputs from different shards collide on the same series → silently wrong totals. Keep the shard key in `by:` on every downstream rule, and do any further roll-up at query time. |
| Sharding histograms by `le` (or `vmrange`) | Splits one histogram's buckets across shards; each shard emits a partial bucket set; `histogram_quantile()` over the merged result is silently wrong. Shard histograms by a non-bucket label (`instance`, `kubernetes_namespace`, `__name__`) and keep `le` in `by:`. |
| `dedup_interval` differs from storage `-dedup.minScrapeInterval` | Raw vs aggregated query results diverge. Make them equal. |
| Aggregating histograms without `enable_windows` | Misaligned samples → wrong quantiles. Set `enable_windows: true`. |
| Renaming output to original metric name, but raw still flows | Two different series with the same name. Either drop input (`-streamAggr.dropInput`) or keep the suffix. |
| One aggregation rule per recording rule | Each rule scans every sample. Merge rules with shared `interval` and `by`/`without` using a list-form `match:`. |
| Setting `staleness_interval` too low for sporadic inputs | State resets between samples → wrong totals. Raise it to cover the expected gap. |
| `keep_metric_names: true` with multiple outputs | Not allowed — only valid with a single output. |
| Forgetting to update alert/recording rules | Old rules query a metric that no longer exists (or, worse, exists but is now empty raw). |

## Quick Reference

```yaml
# Skeleton — start here, fill in `match`, `interval`, `without`/`by`, `outputs`.
- name: <name>
  match: '<selector>'
  interval: 30s
  without: [pod, instance]
  outputs: [rate_sum]              # see output picker
  # enable_windows: true           # histograms; delayed inputs
  # dedup_interval: 30s            # match storage dedup
  # staleness_interval: 4m         # for sporadic inputs
```

**Output picker (90% of cases):**
- Counter, want sum-of-rate: `rate_sum`
- Counter, want monotonic counter: `total`
- Histogram bucket: `rate_sum` + `enable_windows: true`
- Gauge, latest: `last`
- Gauge, sum across sources: `sum_samples`
- Gauge, percentiles: `quantiles(0.5, 0.9, 0.99)`

**Decision shortcuts:**
- Interval = max(2 × scrape_interval, shortest consumer window / 2)
- Drop `pod`/`instance` unless per-source is consumed
- HA vmagents: identical input + identical config + identical output labels → vmstorage dedups. **Don't tag** replicas. HA-safe outputs only (no `total`/`total_prometheus`/`histogram_bucket`).
- Sharded vmagents: keep the shard key in `by:`, or tag each replica and roll up at query time.
- Behind a round-robin LB: stop. Use deterministic sharding (`-remoteWrite.shardByURL.labels`) or fan-out.
- Replacing recording rule: set `interval` = rule's evaluation interval, use a list-form `match:` to fold many rules into one config entry.
