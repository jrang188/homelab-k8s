# Troubleshooting with Observability Skills

## Core Principle

Random querying wastes time and produces misleading results. Empty results from wrong metric names look identical to "no problem exists." Jumping between signals without a hypothesis leads to thrashing.

**Discover before you query. Hypothesize before you correlate. Confirm before you conclude.**

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose root causes. If you haven't correlated across at least two signal types, your conclusion is a guess.

## The Investigation Protocol

Complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

```
Phase 1: Gather Signals     → What's already known? What's alerting?
Phase 2: Discover and Scope  → What data exists? What are the real names?
Phase 3: Hypothesize and Test → Form one theory, query to confirm or refute
Phase 4: Correlate and Confirm → Cross-reference across signal types, find root cause
```

### Phase 1: Gather Signals

Before writing any query, establish what's already known.

**1. Check env var availability** — run the gating check from the Subagent Dispatch section.

**2. Dispatch signal-gathering subagents in parallel:**

| Subagent | Condition | What it does |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| AlertManager check | `VM_ALERTMANAGER_URL` available | Checks VM alerts + AlertManager alerts and silences |
| Metrics discovery (alerts only) | `VM_METRICS_URL` available AND `VM_ALERTMANAGER_URL` NOT available | Checks VM alerts as fallback when AlertManager agent can't be dispatched |

If `VM_ALERTMANAGER_URL` IS available, the AlertManager check agent handles BOTH VM alerts and AlertManager queries — no need to dispatch a separate metrics agent for alerts.

Read the agent prompt files and dispatch in a single Agent tool call. Include in each subagent's prompt:

- The agent file content
- The investigation target (namespace, service, or component name if known)

**3. Synthesize results** — once subagents return:

- Combine alert findings from all sources
- Establish a timeline: when did symptoms start? What changed?
- If timeline is unclear, ask the user

**4. Identify which signal type to start with:**

| Symptom | Start with | Then correlate with |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Resource/rate issue | Metrics | Logs |
| Errors/crashes | Logs | Metrics |
| Latency/slow requests | Traces | Logs |
| Alert firing | Metrics (alert details) | Logs + Traces |

### Phase 2: Discover and Scope

**Never guess metric names, log field names, or service names.** Discovery is not optional — it prevents the single most common investigation failure: drawing conclusions from empty results caused by wrong names.

**Dispatch discovery subagents in parallel** for ALL available backends. Read each agent prompt file and dispatch in a single Agent tool call. Include in each subagent's prompt:

- The agent file content
- Target namespace and/or service name (from Phase 1 findings)
- Time range for the investigation (RFC3339 format)
- Any specific keywords or components to search for

| Subagent | Condition |
|----------|-----------|
| Metrics discovery | `VM_METRICS_URL` available |
| Logs discovery | `VM_LOGS_URL` available |
| Traces discovery | `VM_TRACES_URL` available |

**Synthesize discovery results:**

- Merge discovered names across all backends
- Note which backends have data for the target and which don't
- Identify the richest signal source for Phase 3 hypothesis testing

**Consult skill references for complex queries.** You do NOT know LogsQL syntax from training data — it is NOT Loki LogQL. For complex queries beyond what the subagents already ran, invoke the corresponding `*-query` skill or use the LogsQL Quick Reference below.

### Phase 3: Hypothesize and Test

After discovery, form a specific hypothesis before querying further.

**State it clearly:** "I think [component X] is [failing/slow/OOM] because [evidence Y from Phase 1]."

**Test minimally:**

- Query ONE thing to confirm or refute the hypothesis
- Don't query everything at once — you'll drown in data
- Use instant queries first (cheaper, faster) before range queries

**If the hypothesis is wrong:**

- Don't add more queries on top — form a NEW hypothesis
- Re-examine what Phase 1 and Phase 2 revealed
- Ask: did discovery show anything unexpected?

**After 3 failed hypotheses: STOP.**
Three wrong guesses means you're missing something fundamental. Either:

- A key data source hasn't been discovered yet
- The scope is wrong (different namespace, different service, different time range)
- You need to ask the user for more context

### Phase 4: Correlate and Confirm

A single signal type is not proof. Correlate across at least two before concluding.

**Dispatch correlation subagents in parallel** for the signal types you need. Reuse the same agent prompt files from `agents/`, but provide specific queries rather than discovery tasks. Include in each subagent's prompt:

- The agent file content
- The specific query to run (metric expression, log filter, trace search parameters)
- The exact time range to query (narrowed from Phase 3 findings)
- What to look for (the confirmed hypothesis from Phase 3)

Example parallel dispatch for correlation:

- Metrics agent: "Query `rate(http_requests_total{code=~'5..', namespace='myapp'}[5m])` from T1 to T2"
- Logs agent: "Search `{namespace='myapp'} error` from T1 to T2, return sample messages"
- Traces agent: "Search traces for service `myapp` with `minDuration=1s` from T1 to T2"

**Correlation techniques:**

- **Time-based**: Identify anomaly timestamp in metrics, query logs/traces at that time
- **Trace ID**: Find trace IDs in traces, search logs for `trace_id:"<id>"`
- **Pod name**: Get pod name from metrics labels, use it in log stream filters

**Only after correlation:** propose root cause and remediation.

## Red Flags — STOP and Return to Phase 1

If you catch yourself:

- Proposing a root cause after querying only one signal type
- Writing a LogsQL query from memory without checking syntax
- Querying a metric name you haven't confirmed exists via discovery
- Getting empty results and concluding "no problem"
- Skipping the alerts check because "it's probably not that"
- Running five different queries hoping one shows something
- Saying "let me just try..." instead of forming a hypothesis

**All of these mean: STOP. You're guessing, not investigating.**

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "I know the metric name" | Maybe. Discovery takes 2 seconds and prevents 20 minutes of chasing empty results. |
| "Alerts won't help here" | Alerts are free to check and frequently contain the exact answer. Skip at your peril. |
| "Just need to check logs quickly" | Quick log checks without discovery produce wrong field names and misleading results. |
| "Empty results = no problem" | Empty results more often mean wrong query than absent problem. Verify names first. |
| "I'll correlate later" | Single-signal conclusions are guesses. Correlate before claiming root cause. |
| "LogsQL is like LogQL/Elasticsearch" | It's not. The syntax differences cause silent failures. Consult the reference. |

## Environment

Environment is controlled by env vars. Check current state:

```bash
echo "VM_METRICS_URL:      $VM_METRICS_URL"
echo "VM_LOGS_URL:         $VM_LOGS_URL"
echo "VM_TRACES_URL:       $VM_TRACES_URL"
echo "VM_ALERTMANAGER_URL: $VM_ALERTMANAGER_URL"
echo "VM_CURL_CONFIG:      ${VM_CURL_CONFIG:-(unset - no auth)}"
```

If unsure which environment the application runs in, ask user.

## Subagent Dispatch

This skill dispatches parallel subagents at phase boundaries to speed up investigations. Each subagent carries embedded API reference and returns structured findings.

### Env Var Gating

Before each dispatch round, check which backends are available:

```bash
echo "METRICS:${VM_METRICS_URL:+available}"
echo "LOGS:${VM_LOGS_URL:+available}"
echo "TRACES:${VM_TRACES_URL:+available}"
echo "ALERTMANAGER:${VM_ALERTMANAGER_URL:+available}"
```

**Only dispatch subagents for backends that report `available`.** Do not dispatch a subagent if its env var is empty or unset.

### How to Dispatch

1. Read the agent prompt file from the `agents/` directory (relative to this skill's directory)
2. Use the Agent tool to dispatch, including:
   - The agent prompt file content as the base instructions
   - Investigation context: target namespace, service name, time range (RFC3339)
   - Any specific queries or metrics to look for
3. Dispatch independent subagents in the SAME tool-call message for parallel execution
4. Set `allowed-tools: Bash(curl:*), Bash(jq:*), Bash(date:*)` on each subagent

### Agent Files

| Agent | File | Requires | Used in |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| AlertManager check | `agents/alertmanager-check.md` | `VM_ALERTMANAGER_URL` + `VM_METRICS_URL` | Phase 1 |
| Metrics discovery | `agents/metrics-discovery.md` | `VM_METRICS_URL` | Phase 2, 4 |
| Logs discovery | `agents/logs-discovery.md` | `VM_LOGS_URL` | Phase 2, 4 |
| Traces discovery | `agents/traces-discovery.md` | `VM_TRACES_URL` | Phase 2, 4 |

## Skill-to-API Mapping

```
victoriametrics-query  = Metrics only (MetricsQL/PromQL) → $VM_METRICS_URL
victorialogs-query     = Logs only (LogsQL)              → $VM_LOGS_URL
victoriatraces-query   = Traces only (Jaeger API)        → $VM_TRACES_URL
alertmanager-query     = AlertManager (silences, routing) → $VM_ALERTMANAGER_URL
```

Never cross APIs between backends. Use the correct env var and endpoint for each data type.

AlertManager provides what VM alerts cannot: **silences** and **inhibition state**. But it's in-cluster and may be down — fall back to `$VM_METRICS_URL/api/v1/alerts` when unavailable.

## Timestamp Formats

| Backend | Parameter | Format | Example |
|---------|-----------|--------|---------|
| VictoriaMetrics | start/end | RFC3339 string | `2026-02-06T09:00:00Z` |
| VictoriaLogs | start (REQUIRED), end | RFC3339 string | `2026-02-06T09:00:00Z` |
| VictoriaTraces | start/end | Unix microseconds NUMBER | `1738836000000000` (16 digits) |
| VictoriaTraces (dependencies) | endTs/lookback | Unix milliseconds NUMBER | `1738836000000` (13 digits) / `3600000` |

VictoriaLogs `start` is always required — omitting it scans ALL stored data (extremely expensive).

## Discovery Protocol

Follow this order for each signal type. For full API details and additional endpoints, invoke the corresponding query skill.

### Metrics Discovery → `victoriametrics-query` skill

1. **Search metadata** by keyword: `$VM_METRICS_URL/api/v1/metadata?metric=<keyword>&limit=10`
2. **Label values** for scoping: `$VM_METRICS_URL/api/v1/label/<label_name>/values` (filter with `match[]`)
3. **Series** for a namespace: `$VM_METRICS_URL/api/v1/series?limit=20` with `match[]={namespace="X"}`
4. **Then query** — instant at `api/v1/query` or range at `api/v1/query_range` (range requires `start`, RFC3339)

### Logs Discovery → `victorialogs-query` skill

ALL VictoriaLogs endpoints require `start` (RFC3339). Use `--data-urlencode` for the query parameter.

1. **Stream field names**: `$VM_LOGS_URL/select/logsql/stream_field_names?start=<RFC3339>`
2. **Stream field values**: `$VM_LOGS_URL/select/logsql/stream_field_values?start=<RFC3339>&field=namespace`
3. **Facets** (best discovery tool — all field distributions in one call): `$VM_LOGS_URL/select/logsql/facets?start=<RFC3339>`
4. **Non-stream field names**: `$VM_LOGS_URL/select/logsql/field_names?start=<RFC3339>`
5. **Then query** (JSON Lines response): `$VM_LOGS_URL/select/logsql/query?start=<RFC3339>&limit=100`

### Traces Discovery → `victoriatraces-query` skill

Trace discovery endpoints accept NO time-range parameters:

1. **List services**: `$VM_TRACES_URL/api/services`
2. **Operations for a service**: `$VM_TRACES_URL/api/services/<service>/operations`
3. **Dependencies** (Unix milliseconds, 13 digits): `$VM_TRACES_URL/api/dependencies?endTs=<ms>&lookback=3600000`
4. **Then search traces** (`service` required, times in Unix microseconds, 16 digits): `$VM_TRACES_URL/api/traces?service=<svc>&start=<µs>&end=<µs>&limit=20`

## LogsQL Quick Reference

For full LogsQL syntax, invoke the `victorialogs-query` skill. Key points:

- LogsQL is space-separated (AND by default). Pipes use `|`.
- Stream filters: `{namespace="myapp"}`
- Word filters: `{namespace="myapp"} error`
- OR: `(error OR warning)`, Regex: `~"err|warn"`, Field-specific: `level:error`
- Time filter: `_time:1h` (alternative to API `start`/`end` params — use one OR the other, never both)
- Negation: `-"expected error"`
- Stats: `| stats by (level) count() as total`

**Common mistakes:** `| grep` does NOT exist (use word filters or `~"regex"`). `| filter` is valid ONLY after `| stats`. Stream field names depend on ingestion config — discover them first.

## Investigation Playbooks

### "Application is slow"

1. **Phase 1**: Check alerts. Establish timeline — when did latency increase?
2. **Phase 2**: Discover traced services and metrics matching the app
3. **Phase 3**: Hypothesize — "latency is in [service X] based on [alert/user report]"
   - Query latency/error rate metrics for that service
   - Search traces with `minDuration` filter to find slow spans
4. **Phase 4**: Correlate trace timestamps with logs around those times

### "Pod crash looping"

1. **Phase 1**: Check alerts (may already show KubePodCrashLooping). Get pod name.
2. **Phase 2**: Discover metrics for restart counts, memory usage. Discover log streams for the pod.
3. **Phase 3**: Hypothesize — OOM? Liveness probe failure? Startup crash?
   - Regular interval crashes → liveness probe. Memory spike before crash → OOM.
4. **Phase 4**: Correlate error logs with metric timestamps to confirm cause.

### "Resource growing"

1. **Phase 1**: Check alerts. How fast is it growing?
2. **Phase 2**: Discover resource usage metrics for the namespace/pod
3. **Phase 3**: Hypothesize — leak? Increased load? Missing limits?
   - Use `deriv()` or `increase()` to quantify growth rate
   - Check per-pod breakdown to isolate the culprit
4. **Phase 4**: Correlate with deployment events in logs. Did growth start after a deploy?

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Guessing metric names | Use metadata endpoint: `$VM_METRICS_URL/api/v1/metadata?metric=keyword` |
| Writing LogsQL from memory | Consult LogsQL Quick Reference above or victorialogs-query skill |
| Wrong timestamp format | See Timestamp Formats table above |
| Skipping alerts check | Query `$VM_METRICS_URL/api/v1/alerts` first — it's free |
| Empty results → "no problem" | Verify metric/field names exist via discovery first |
| Not using `facets` for log exploration | `facets` returns field distributions in one call |
| Not URL-encoding queries | Use `--data-urlencode 'query=...'` for POST requests |
| Missing `start` on VictoriaLogs | Omitting `start` scans ALL data (extremely expensive) |
| Forgetting `match[]` needs `[]` | `match` alone won't work — must be `match[]` |
| Wrong timestamp type for traces | Search uses MICROSECONDS (16 digits), dependencies use MILLISECONDS (13 digits) |
| Confusing `stats_query` vs `stats_query_range` | Instant uses `time`, range uses `start`/`end`/`step` |
| Mixing `_time:` filter with API `start` | Use one OR the other, never both |
| Searching "error" catching vmselect noise | Add `-"vm_slow_query_stats"` to exclude PromQL text |
| Grouping logs by `cluster` field | Vector logs lack `cluster` stream field — use `kubernetes.pod_namespace` |
| Blocking on AlertManager failure | Use VM alerts as primary, AlertManager as best-effort |
| Single-signal conclusion | Correlate across at least two signal types before claiming root cause |
